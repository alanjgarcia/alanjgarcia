### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## My name is Alan Garcia. I am a bilingual Latino software developer from Chicago Illinois. I have a passion for soccer, teaching, and coding! My other personal interests include Jiu Jitsu, reading, and hiking.  

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating an xbar that allows me to see the upcoming schedule of my favorite soccer team, Arsenal! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and HTML. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on group projects focused on facilitating the jobs of teachers. 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Jiu Jitsu. I just began my journey and I cannot wait to move up in rank!

âš¡ Fun fact: I have been an elementary education teacher for 3 years! I actually learned about coding through one of my students on a kid-friendly app named Scratch Jr. That is where my journey into tech began!
